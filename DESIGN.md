FRONT-END

The design of the website was built using CSS. The home page has a button that performs the “submit” request.

  Pictures of the shop were used for the  backgrounds of all the pages for customers to get an unofficial overview of the items in the shop.

 A view port function was included so that the website runs on all sizes of screens


I made the texts on the navbar direct a user to a different page and did not include everything on a scrolling page to make the website very easy to navigate and organise.

The “logout” button was put in the nav bar for easy logging out by a customer.


The navigation bar has a menu for easily switching of pages. This was designed using the “on click” function.


The navbar automatically becomes a close button for easily navigation by users

Google fonts, CS colours, and bootstrap features were imported from the web.





BACK-END

 The final.db is the database of the website.   It has 3 fields that store the namely: name, email,  and password of a registered user. It  has an ID which is a primary key- automatically generated by the database when a user registers.

The website was designed to take data as input, store it in the database.
